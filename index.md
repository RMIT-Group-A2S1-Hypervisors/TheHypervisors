<p>Photoshop, Chess, Walking my dog, researching latest science, and cooking.</p>
<h3><b>IT Interests:</b></h3>
<p>I started getting interested in computers after being given an Amiga 500 for mowing one of my mums friend's lawns a few times and it came with about 500 games on giant floppy discs.  It was games originally that got me interested, but s I became a teenager I was most impressed with discussion boards, internet relay chat and the potential for the internet to connect me with like minded indiviuals all over the world.  I became obsessed with computers around 13-13 years of age.</p>
<h3><b>IT Experience:</b></h3>
<p>I did IT in years 11 & 12 and then started a Bachelor of IT at Griffith university in Brisbane.  I did half of this degree but left to start an internet company.  I stopped using computers again till I was mid 20s and have had an active interest in them since.  I have worked on several database driven websites but feel I have quite a basic knowledge of website design.</p>

  <h1><b>Ideal Jobs</b></h1>
  <h3>Kias Henry</h3>
  <h3>Senior/Lead Developer (Blockchain)</h3>
    <p>This is a job for a Senior/Lead developer to work for a cryptocurrency trading business. The business works with several large cryptocurrency exchanges to perform Peer to Peer trading. I feel a job like this would be ideal for me as I am fascinated by what blockchain makes possible online. This job would allow me to be involved with app development, website development and design, work with APIs, the Python programming language as well as the latest internet technologies. I have had an interest in cybersecurity since a teenager and because of the inherent risks with blockchains re cyber attacks/hacks I think it would be amazing to work in a position like this where I had to stay up to date with cyber security topics to ensure I could write efficient, safe code that wasn't easily exploited for my client.</p>
    <p>I find this job very attractive because they also state the successful applicant may get shares in the company, may be able to extend onto being manager of the whole IT department, and it also says the work can be remote.</p>
    <p>The position asks for an exceptional understanding of Python, knowledge of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, front end development tools such as Javascript, VueJS, React & Angular. The company is also saying someone with programming experience in C++, Java, Go, Node & Solidity is beneficial. Further they state knowledge of RDBMS or NoSQL databases is also beneficial.</p>
    <p>I have skills in web development, PHP, some Python (from this course already), database design however I am familiar with MYSQL and Phpmyadmin. I have no experience with VueJS, React, Angular, RDBMS, or NoSQL. I have played around with a small Solidity file to make my own cryptocurrency coin on Binance Smart Chain using Remix. I have experience as a web designer, web admin and database admin for large scale commercial projects, as well as some private projects.</p>
    <p>My plan to be able to fulfil all the requirements for this role is to continue to learn as much as I can about blockchain technologies, Solidity, Javascript and cyber security. I will research all of the skills I do not currently have to better advance my understanding throughout this degree. I will continue to stay up to date with the latest web technologies, and also hone my skills on programming automated systems.</p>

  <p>This video shows what Karl, an Indie Game Developer with a YouTube channel called ThinMatrix, does during a day at work.  He is currently developing a city-builder game. He also developed the nature-themed sandbox game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/853550/Equilinox/">Equilinox</a> which is available on Steam.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>What kind of work does the IT professional perform?</b></li><br>
      <p>As an Indie Games Developer Karl spends his day adapting code, mainly working on developing the save function for his city-builder, adding additional functions to the    behaviour trees of NPCs, so that activities performed have multiple actions and aligning these actions with a status of Running, Passed or Failed, and a Boolean value of    either True, for both Passed and Failed, or False for Running.  He spent the afternoon working on a new developer tool to import mesh information regarding points of       interest (nodes and how these nodes are connected) from a 3D model, and then converts the information to a format suitable Entities document, which is then viewed in Notepad++.  To do this he opens the 3d model in Blender and then applies a mesh showing how all nodes are connected, and then exports the information into a Wavefront (.obj) file, and then created a new Java file that imports the .obj file and then extracts the necessary mesh data, converts the data so the Entities file can read it, and the exports the data to the clipboard, so it can be copied and pasted into the Entities file.</p>
    <li><b>What kinds of people do they interact with? Other IT professionals, Clients, Investors, or the general public</b></li><br>
    <p>Karl responds to emails and comments left on his YouTube videos from the general public.</p>

  <h1><b>IT Technologies</b></h1>
  <h2><b>Autonomous Vehicles</b></h2>
  <ul>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <li><b>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</b></li>
  <p>These cars utilise sensory devices such as GPS, radar, sonor, lidar and inertial measuring units.  They use an internal computer to interpret this sensory data and make informed 'decisions' about the safest driving options in any given moment. According to Dingyi(2018) these cars rely on "environmental perception, decision making and motion control" to operate.  The first driverless car was made by google which they called Waymo in October of 2015 they took their first solo drive around Austin in a 10 minute trip, in one of their early 'pod' models.  According to Twi-Global (2019) there are six levels of autonomous driving:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>At level 0, the car has no control over its operation and the human driver does all of the driving.</p></li>
  <li><p>At level 1, the vehicle’s ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) has the ability to support the driver with either steering or accelerating and braking.</p></li>
  <li><p>At level 2, the ADAS can oversee steering and accelerating and braking in some conditions, although the human driver is required to continue paying complete attention to the driving environment throughout the journey, while also performing the remainder of the necessary tasks.</p></li>
  <li><p>At level 3, the ADS (advanced driving system) can perform all parts of the driving task in some conditions, but the human driver is required to be able to regain control when requested to do so by the ADS. In the remaining conditions, the human driver executes the necessary tasks.</p></li>
  <li><p>At level 4, the vehicle’s ADS is able to perform all driving tasks independently in certain conditions in which human attention is not required.</p></li>
  <li><p>Finally, level 5 involves full automation whereby the vehicle’s ADS is able to perform all tasks in all conditions, and no driving assistance is required from the human driver. This full automation will be enabled by the application of 5G technology, which will allow vehicles to communicate not just with one another, but also with traffic lights, signage and even the roads themselves.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The market for global autonomous vehicles is currently at over $54 billion and could reach more than ten times that amount by 2026. Drivers for this technology include regulatory pressure, increasing connectivity by passengers, high cost of vehicle ownership, and disinterest by an increasingly large segment of the population to own a vehicle outright. (Kimmel, 2019).  Kimmel also goes on to state that the latest advancements in AI & Imaging technology are pushing forward the limits on what is possible with these robo-cars.</p>


  <li><b>What can be done now?</b></li>
  <p>Unlike earlier cars, the latest cars use sensors that created a 3d picture around the vehicle and the AI interprets how the vehicle should respond.  Kimmel (2019) also states that while there have been improvements in this technology a big jump will come when the processing time between camera and computer in the car can be massively minimised compared to what it is now. Modern Autonomous Vehicles (AV) also utilise thermal imaging which can detect longer wavelengths than the visible spectrum making it great at detecting animals, humans, or obstructions on the road in dense foggy or rainy conditions. FLIR is leading the way in thermal imaging for AV's (Dingyi 2018)</p>


  <li><b>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</b></li>
  <p>As AI continues to evolve, as well as cloud computing and blockchain developments it is possible that enhanced computing speeds will mean all of the current sensors used on AV's will be able to be processed much quicker, essentially meaning these vehicles will be able to make much more calculated decisions in the split seconds where it really matters.  Just as a chess computer given more time is usually a much stronger player, as technology speeds up processing power, AV's will be much stronger drivers on the road.</p>

  <li><b>What technological or other developments make this possible?</b></li>
  <p>There are developments outside of the vehicles that can also enhance the way these vehicles will interact with their environment, for example increased numbers of sattelites, sensors placed on roads and around cities, enhancements to internet speeds in general such as 5G, and the list goes on.</p>
  
   <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
  <li><b>What is the potential impact of this development?</b></li>
  <p>Innovations in AV may fundamentally transform how the current transportation system works and change our lives in terms of how we travel. As is the case in all disruptions, AVs will bring slowdown and present new opportunities in the form of new business models.  (Capgemini, 2020)</p>

  <li><b>What is likely to change?</b></li>
  <p>As AV's become safer and safer, it is likely more of them will appear on the roads, and they will disrupt many road based industries such as delivery, transport, and so on. It is also likely people will be doing work from within their cars conneted to the internet, just like in offices, while their AV's handle the driving load while they wait in traffic or are on long trips.</p>

  <li><b>Which people will be most affected and how?</b></li>
  <p>This is going to affect those who's employment relies on the roads, such as cab drivers, delivery drivers, bus drivers, and so on. But that being said, there are many industries this will effect indirectly, but in a big way for example Hotels and Motels, as many people on long trips need sleep and book in for the night.  With driverless vehicles they will no longer need to pay money to a hotel or motel along the way (AutoTrader, 2017).  People may choose AV's instead of airlines or public transportation.  Even Auto parts sellers will be effected as most car accidents (which then require new car parts) are caused by human errors, so less crashes means less income for this industry (AutoTrader, 2017).</p>

  <li><b>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</b></li>
  <p>Other industries effected will be ride hailing companies, fast food will be less likely as the trips will already be programmed in and users may not even notice the fast food signs while doing other things. We should also not forget driving schools will become affected heavily, as requirements for driver proficiency becomes less and less into the future.  Last but not least law enforcement will have a hard time booking autonomous vehicles for speeding, bad driving or causing accidents.</p>
  <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
    <li><b>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</b></li>
  <p>If I wish to catch a taxi, drive on the roads, get a bus, ride a motorbike, drive a truck or any other transport on roads, the rise of autonomous vehicles will effect me whether I like it or not as they will be on the roads, they may malfunction, they might stop suddenly, they might also make the roads a safer place it is hard to say.</p>

  <li><b>What will be different for you?</b></li>
  <p>According to the statistics so far, driverless cars, like autopilot in planes, can make the roads safer so it should mean that life is safer on the roads for me.  It will mean less chance of work becoming a cab or uber driver for example.</p>

  <li><b>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</b></li>
  <p>This is such a big change to the cars on the roads and driving in general that it will affect everybody who uses the roads in any way shape or form.  Just like how it will effect me, it may either positively or negatively affect my friends and family but the hope is with time, and increased technological breakthrough that overall it will effect my friends and family in a very positive, safety increasing way.

  <h2>Clouds Services, and Servers</h2>
  <ul>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <li><b>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</b></li>
  <p>In January Dell Technologies (2021) produced a list of the top 10 trends in the server market.  These trends focused on how aaS (as a Service) options are becoming more popular as companies look for ways to reduce overhead after a turbulent year facing a global pandemic.  The arrival of 5G Technology will allow for a quicker movement of data over networks, by offering faster data transmission speeds, reduces congestion by increasing bandwidth and reducing latency (Telstra n.d.).  The server industry is progressing from Compute-Centric Architectures to Data Centric Architectures where data is viewed as a critical component of a company’s decision-making process (Vista Projects 2021).</p>

  <li><b>What can be done now?</b></li>
  <p>Server virtualization is a way for companies to reduce their reliance on physical infrastructure and separates a single server into multiple virtual servers that can run independently of each other, and thus allows for multiple servers to run off a single physical server (Network Coverage n.d.).  Thus, server virtualization allows companies to reduce their overheads by reducing their <br>
    publisher hysical server needs, as well as the ongoing maintenance costs, as well a reducing the energy requirements needed to run these physical servers and to provide cooling (Network Coverage n.d.).  Server virtualisation also aids companies with disaster recovery, by allowing them to transfer from one server to another quickly and easily (Network Coverage n.d.).
    Cloud computing services (aaS) offer companies the ability to move some or all of their on-site business requirements to a third-party provider (Red Hat 2019).  Companies can choose to from IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), where they move their networking, storage, server and virtualization to a third-party provider, examples include AWS Simple Storage Service and Elastic Compute Cloud, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, or PaaS (Platform as a Service) where a company moves not just their infrastructure needs but also some of their application-software needs, examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, IBM Cloud Pak for Applications, Microsoft Azure Cloud Services, and Red Hat OpenShift, or  SaaS (Software as Service) where a company hands over all their needs to a third-party provider, examples include Adobe Creative Cloud, DocuSign, Microsoft 365, Slack, Zoom (Red Hat 2019).  In addition to IaaS, PaaS and SaaS there is also FaaS (Function as a Service which allows companies to develop and manage application packages directly from the cloud, examples include Amazon Web Services Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, IBM Cloud Functions, and Microsoft Azure Functions, (Red Hat 2019).

  <li><b>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</b></li>
  <p>The computer server manufacturing industry is trying to increase the areal density, the amount of storage space that a magnetic disc and tape can hold, and this is calculated by the number of bits per inch (bpi) multiplied by the number of tracks per inch (tpi) (World Wide Technology 2020).  In December 2020 IBM announced that in collaboration with Fujifilm their team of researcher achieved an areal density of 317 billion bits per square inch (B/i2 an increase of 116 billion B/i2 from the previous record of 201 B/i2 in 2017 (Lantz 2020).  Via the usage of advanced networking acceleration technology, such as Intel’s I/O Acceleration Technology, data can be moved over a network more efficiently and this results in a reduction of system overheads (Intel n.d.).  Improvements are being researched into the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), with research into the TCP being focused on modifying the TCP stack to offer increased downloading ability, as well as improving FAST TCP, a congestion control algorithm designed for long-distance and high-latency network connections (Stone 2017).</p>
  <p>Future research is being aimed at server disaggregation, which will break down server components into self-operating parts connected via a network (Fulton III 2020).  The main benefits of server disaggregation are that network functions will be removed from the central processing unit (CPU) to the new data processing unit (DPU), with the DPU being a component of a SmartNIC (network interface card), as moving data storage to an interface managed by the DPU, thus increasing security as now the CPU will now access stored data from the network rather then system bus (Fulton III 2020).</p>

  <li><b>What technological or other developments make this possible?</b></li>
  <p>Virtualization was the catalyst for cloud computing by allowing for an economy of virtual resources made up of virtual servers, virtual storage devices, and virtual operating systems (Tyagi 2021).</p>
  
   <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
  <li><b>What is the potential impact of this development?</b></li>
  <p>By 2023 global public cloud services usage will reach more than double the amount of 2019, with Software as a Service (SaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) seeing the largest growth as more companies in the public service, discrete manufacturing, and the banking sector move from using physical servers (World Wide Technology 2020).</p>

  <li><b>What is likely to change?</b></li>
  <p>Cloud computing services are going to expand as the demand for their services from companies looking beyond their current on-site requirements to basing some, if not all, of their business requirements online (Tyagi 2021).  The scalability of cloud computing services is one of its major benefits and this is one of the main factors that drives companies to prefer cloud computing services over traditional on-site requirements, with storage capacity, processing power and networking capabilities all easily and quickly being scaled up (VMware n.d.).</p>

  <li><b>Which people will be most affected and how?</b></li>
  <p>Panduit (n.d.) suggest that the main reasons behind companies embracing cloud computing services is due to data ballooning in size, as well as the projects working with Artificial Intelligence that put a massive strain on on-site facilities and networks.  Virtualization provides many benefits to cloud computing services, firstly by offering added security through the usage of firewalls to prevent unauthorised access and cyber threats and via the usage of encryption protocols (Tyagi 2021).</p>

  <li><b>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</b></li>
  <p>As server disaggregation becomes functional, it will likely replace the old systems of blade and rack mounting currently used in servers (World Wide Technology 2020).</p>
  <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
    <li><b>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</b></li>
  <p>For many people the rise of Cloud storage has seen new ways to save data and documents and allows to easy access to documents anywhere and at any time.  The 5G network will enable faster download and upload speeds, allowing users the ability to access content quicker, as well as share information more easily.</p>

  <li><b>What will be different for you?</b></li>
  <p>For many people that are looking to enter the IT field changes to cloud computing, networking speeds and capabilities, as well as server upgrades will alter how they are able to perform the tasks that they are assigned.</p>

  <li><b>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</b></li>
  <p>Friends and family members will see similar benefits from Could storage and the 5G network, as these allow anyone with access to these services the ability to access and share information quickly and easily.</p>

  <h2>Cybersercurity</h2>
  <ul>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <li>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</li>
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) that used an artificial neural network are currently being used by cybersecurity system to gather and analyse vast quantities of data, looking for certain patterns that distinguish cyber-attacks so that it can learn how to better detect, identify, and address these issues (St. Thomas University 2021).

  <li>What can be done now?</li>
  <p>Cyber-attacks are any attempts to breach a computer system or network where the intent is often to steal data, disable computers and networks, or to launch additional attacks (Unisys n.d.).  There are a variety of ways for to launch a cyber-attack, with the most common being malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle, distributed denial of service (DDoS), SQL injection, zero-day exploit, and DNS tunnelling (Cisco n.d.).  Malware is a blanket term for any malicious software that gains access to a computer or network via a vulnerability, and then performs a specified task depending on the type of malware (Cisco n.d.).  There are several ways for companies to protect themselves against malware, which include installing anti-virus and anti-malware software, and performing regular updates, to ensure that attackers cannot use any vulnerabilities in older and outdated software (Dholakiya 2020).  Enable two-factor authentication and introducing a company policy with states that employees can only use super-strong passwords, that they must change them regularly, and never allowed passwords to be saved on a computer or network, as well as using biometric tools like fingerprint scanners and facial recognition software whenever possible (Dholakiya 2020).  Logins should be set to expire after a set period of inactivity, and there should be a limit to the number of login attempts (Dholakiya 2020).  Administration privileges should be used sparingly and should only be used when carrying out necessary administrative tasks (Dholakiya 2020).  Employees should be trained to spot malware, phishing schemes, and other potential malicious links (Dholakiya 2020).</p>
  <p>Phishing is the term for any fraudulent communication that attempts to appear that it comes from a reputable and legitimate source (Jefferson 2021).  Training employees to be able to detect phishing schemes is one of the easiest ways to prevent these kinds of attacks.  Employees should be made aware of the red flags that can identify potential phishing schemes, which include grammatical errors, scare tactics, and dangerous and sketchy attachments (Telstra n.d.).  Anti-virus software should be used to detect and malware that may come from the phishing scheme attachments, and spam filter should be filter out any potential viruses, or emails that may contain malicious links or attachments (Telstra n.d.).  Companies should enforce a password policy where employees are required to change their passwords regularly and can only use super-strong passwords and utilise to-factor or multi-factor authentication (Telstra n.d.).  All sensitive company information should be encrypted, use secure internet browser, and ensure that any website visited is secure and trustworthy (Telstra n.d.).</p>
  <p>Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks involve intercepting a communication from one party heading to another party in an attempt to steal personal information (Jefferson 2021).  Encryption protocols, like those used at the Transport Layer Security ensure that all traffic via the internet in encrypted (Swinhoe 2019).  Employee education also plays a major part in prevent MitM attacks, and employees should be told to never use public Wi-Fi, and to heed warnings from internet browsers that websites or connections might not be legitimate (Swinhoe 2019).</p>
  <p>DDoS attacks involves flooding a system, server, or network with a large amount of traffic in an attempt to use up all the available resources and bandwidth (Jefferson 2021).  There are several ways that a company can mitigate DDoS attacks.  The first method involves knowing what a normal internet traffic patterns look like, as anything outside these normal patterns , could identify a potential DDoS attack (Hewitt 2021).  Create a DDoS Response Plan including a checklist of tools like advanced threat detection, assessment, filtering and software and hardware, a well-trained response team, escalation protocols with clearly defined rules of whom to contact and when to contact them, and a communication plan for communicating with internal and external stakeholders (CDNetwork 2020).  Consider using a cloud computing service provider for IaaS, as Amazon Web Services offers a DDOS protection service called Shield that can help mitigate the DDoS attack (Amazon Web Service 2021).  There are a variety of anti-DDoS hardware and software options available on the market, like Indusface AppTrana which offers a Web Application Firewall, DDoS protection, vulnerability scanner that references the OWASP Top 10 Threats and the SANS 25 Vulnerability list and then searches for and patches out any vulnerabilities it discovers, and utilises its own database to develop rules and alert conditions for a companies website, and automatically detect and blocks bots based upon their behaviour (Keary 2021), or Netscout Arbor Edge Defense and inline security appliance that sits between the firewall and the internet router and blocks any inbound cyber threats (Netscout 2021).</p>
  <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) injection involves inserting SQL queries into an input field which is then processed by the underlying SQL database (Positive Technologies 2019).  There are two locations where SQL injections can be detected, and these are in the application or in the network (Cisco n.d.).  There are two main approaches for defending an application against SQL injections.  The first is by validating all user input through blacklisting known malicious characters, that can then either be removed and replaced in user input, and through whitelisting where all user input is compared against a list of permitted characters (Cisco n.d.).  Whitelisting is more effective at mitigating the risk of SQL injection than blacklisting as it is more restrictive in what input will be accepted, and well-implemented whitelisting compared all user inputs against the expected data format (Cisco n.d.).  Parameterized queries and prepared statements can be utilised to fortify SQL statements and ensure that SQL statements cannot be altered by user inputs (Cisco n.d.).  In addition to fortifying SQl statements and whitelisting and blacklist specific characters, the company should also ensure that SQL-generated errors messages are captured before they reach an end user, as these error messages may aid an attacker in successfully finding and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities (Cisco n.d.).  In intrusion prevention system (IPS) can detect and prevent SQL injection attacks that occur in the network, however the IPS must be able to view that traffic heading to the application to be effective, when end-to-end encryption with HTTPS is utilised the IPS will not be able to view the traffic, and thus cannot identify what traffic may be showing the characteristics of a SQL injection attack (Cisco n.d.).  Firewalls can also be utilised to perform deep packet inspections on traffic at the application layer (Cisco n.d.).</p>

  <li>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</li>
  <p>In the near future, will involve service providers taking a more data-centric approach, and company networks extend outwards beyond their physical location, cyber security needs to evolve to meet these needs (Whitehead 2020).  In the future, blockchain could be utilised to take digital signatures, identification authentication, and time stamping and push these to the next level (Whitehead 2020).  In around 25 years, advances in AI technology will allow it to be a much more viable method for detecting cyber-attacks and then either mitigating the damage or blocking it, particular in its ability to process vast quantities of data in a small amount of time, and if incorporated into early warning systems allows for the creation of logic models which will aid in improving an AIs reliability, scalability, flexibility, and thus improve its ability to detect and protect against cyber-attacks (Bulao 2021).  In around 25 years’ time, quantum cryptography will be emerging, and this will make symmetric encryption more secure (Whitehead 2020).</p>

  <li>What technological or other developments make this possible?</li>
  <p>For some of the future advances to come about, there needs to be more advancements in areas of research such as AI, blockchain, and quantum physics.</p>

  <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
  <li>What is the potential impact of this development?</li>
  <p>As more companies start moving as their services to the cloud, it makes these same services a prime target for cybercriminals (Kaspersky 2021).</p>

  <li>What is likely to change?</li>
  <p>Ransomware, a type of malicious code that locks up computer systems after encrypting the data, has slowly been on the rise, and as more companies digitalise their data, combined with more employees now working from their home environment, this has led to cybercriminals having increased access points for their ransomware to exploit (Kaspersky 2021).</p>

  <li>Which people will be most affected and how?</li>
  <p>Businesses are the likely targets for cybercriminals, as they have an increased access to large sums of cash, so makeup the preferred target for cybercriminals.</p>

  <li>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</li>
  <p>According to research conducted by Trend Micro, 41% of IT leaders believe that by 2030 some positions in IT industry will be replaced by AI, with remote and cloud-based systems being hit the hardest (Devanesan 2021).</p>

  <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
  <li>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</li>
  The global pandemic saw a lot of people start working from home, and this exposes company networks to potential risks of cyber-attacks, as the home environment of their employees are going to be less secure than the work environment, with employees having to use their personal mobile phones for team meetings vis Zoom or Microsoft Teams, or even as part of a two-factor authentication process (Kaspersky 2021).  As a variety of devices become tied to the internet in a term called the Internet of Things, it exposes new avenues for cybercriminals to try to gain access to networks, computers, and servers (Kaspersky 2021).</p>

  <li>What will be different for you?</li>
  <p>This has led to an increased awareness of the potential risks of cyber-attacks, and methods that should be implemented in the home and work environments to limit the risk of these attacks.  This has also led to an increased awareness of the safety precautions that need to be implemented into computer programs and well as website design.  This has also increased my interest in a field that is rapidly growing and has potentially changed where my IT career may take me, from leading towards being either a Mobile Applications Developer or Games Developer to look at Cybersecurity.</p>

  <li>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</li>
  <p>The home environment network for friends and family members are mostly susceptible to malware, phishing, and ransomware, and thus it would be prudent to advise friends and family members on the technique, and software/hardware options that can help to alleviate the potential risks.</p>

<h2>Raspberry Pis and SBCs</h2>
  <ul>
  <h3>What Does it do?</h3>
  <p>Raspberry Pis and Arduinos are not exactly the same thing; both share differences.
An arduino is a small microcontroller motherboard, it's a simple computer for running a single program at a time repeatedly (Arduino 2021). An Arduino would be good for simple tasks like opening and closing a door, turning a light on or off or even make them read the temperature rather than publishing the weather to a social site online (Teja 2021).<br>
On the other hand a Raspberry Pi is pretty much a credit card sized general purpose computer complete with a full IO like usbs, ethernet and display outputs (Raspberry Pi Foundation 2021). Overall a Raspberry Pi is a much more complex board than an Arduino so they have the ability to run multiple programs at once and also can complete more complex tasks (Teja 2021). Because a Raspberry Pi is a full fledged PC it can run and complete intense calculations you could even mine bitcoin if you wanted!, you can set up an OS like linux on a Raspberry Pi.</p>
    
  <li>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</li>
  <p>In terms of single board micro computers (SBCs) both the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi don't come close in terms to straight power compared to other more expensive SBCs (Long 2021). However the Raspberry Pi 4 is still one of the best board you can get for normal consumers for the performance you get at the price of $74.50 AUD is incredibly good (Raspberry Pi Australia 2021).</p>
    
  <li>What can be done now?</li>
  <p>SBCs like Arduinos and Raspberry Pis can be used in many different ways today, the most common uses of these boards are; learning how to program and work with robotics, home automation, running NAS drives, perform basic computer task like web browsing, word processing and also create emulation stations like Retropie to run old games (ExplainingComputers n.d.).</p>
    
  <li>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</li>
  <p>SBCs have potentials for future with the ever growing and more powerful hardware components that the industry are projecting to be producing SBCs within the next few years could become even more power efficient than they already are, support higher powered non arm processors like a ryzen cpu from AMD or even support a apu with decent graphics or even a dedicated gpu chip on the board. Although most SBCs are already tiny companies are already trying to make them smaller.  </p>

  <h1><b>Project Idea</b></h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2> <p>
  This project will focus on the development of a game, and will look at the hardware and software requirements, as well as the skills needed to be able to design the game.  This project will be designed to be run on the Windows, Android, and Apple iOS platforms.</p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>This game will be designing is based upon Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG), such as World of Warcraft, and it will address the limitations of typical MMORPGs.  It will be looking at reducing the time commitment needed to play these games, and the need to actively group with other to pursue dungeons or raid dungeons (needing 10+ players).  The system used will be to allow players to recruit friends and Guild members to join them in dungeons and raid dungeons.  The active player will then be able to control the team members skills by selecting what skill that they need the character to use.</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The MMORPG to be designed in 8-bit graphics and will be in 2-dimensions.  This game will draw on elements from early Role-Playing Games like Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger or Suikoden.  It will draw on graphical elements from games like Chrono Trigger for the world overview, as well as for level design.  The gameplay draws inspiration from the turn-based fighting style of games like Final Fantasy or Suikoden, where the characters take actions when their Action Bar maxes out.  Characters have the typical attributes of an RPG, these being Strength, Intellect, Spirit, Agility, Vitality, and Defence.  The particular attributes chosen will depend upon what role the player wishes their character to hold, for instance a tank would need high Vitality and Defence attributes, whereas a Mage or Healer would need high Intellect and Spirit, a Melee Damage character would require high Strength and Agility and may choose to put some points into Vitality for survivability.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strength: which determines Physical Damage;</li>
      <li>Intellect: which determines Magic Damage, and Healing Amount;</li>
      <li>Spirit: which determines Magic Regen;</li>
      <li>Agility: which determines Critical Chance, Dodge Chance, as well as how quickly the Action Bar refills;</li>
      <li>Vitality: which determines how much Health a character has; and</li>
      <li>Defence: which determines how much damage a character can take.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>Characters earn experience from fights, as well as from completing quests, and when a character earns enough experience, they level up and earn a set number of points that they can place in any of the six attributes.  Players can earn weapons, armour, and other items, such as health and mana potions from doing quests or from defeating bosses in dungeons and raid dungeons.  Weapons and armour give a set number of attribute points and a skill, for example a Shield dropped from a dungeon boss would have a value of x number of Vitality or Defence points, and a skill that will reduce incoming damage by a value of x, whereas a Staff would have a value of x number of Intelligence or Spirit points, and a skill aimed at either dealing a value of x number of Magic Damage or Healing a value of x number of health points.  Players will have access to a store where they can purchase health or mana potions, as well as experience boosters, and loot drop rate boosters so that they can minimise their time spent on the game.  Players can also join Guilds, and as the players kill bosses in dungeons and raid dungeons, they earn experience for their Guild.  As the Guild levels up they will be able to purchase items from the Guild Store which increase experience earned or drop rate for items.</p>

  <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
  <p>There are a multitude of software options available for games design, the most popular being GameMaker Studio 2, Unity, and Unreal Engine 4.  The recommended hardware for GameMaker Studio 2 is 64-bit OS, either Windows 10 or macOS Catalina, a Quad Core CPU, 8GB RAM, a dedicated graphics card, an SSD with 3GB free disk space, and an internet connection (YoYo Games 2021).  Additional Software Development Kits (SDK) are required Mac Integrated Development Environment (IDE), namely Mono 6, Xcode, and Steamworks SDK 1.42 is required for Steam builds for both Mac and Windows IDEs (YoYo Games 2021).  The recommended hardware for Unity is 64 bit OS, either Windows 7 (SP1+) and Windows 10 or High Sierra 10.13+, a CPU with X64 architecture with SSE2 instruction set support, and a graphic card capable of DX10, DX11, and DX12-capable GPUs (Unity Technologies 2021).  The recommended hardware for Unreal Engine 4 is Windows 10 64-bit, Quad-core 2.5 GHz CPU, 8 GB RAM, and a DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 compatible graphics card (Epic Games 2021).</p>

  <h2>Skills Required</h2>
  <p>Knowledge of programming languages is a necessity to be able to design a game.  Each of the three main game development software programs uses a different language: GameMaker Studio 2 uses its own proprietary language, GameMaker Language (YoYo Games 2021); Unity requires knowledge of C# (Unity Technologies 2021); and Unreal Engine 4 requires knowledge of C++ (Epic Games 2021).  The ability to draw is an essential skill, as it is required to create the games assets, including User Interface, characters, enemies, .items, and scenery.  Problem solving skills and the capability to think logically are essential when designing levels, systems, artificial intelligence, combat, economy, and quests, as well as when keeping the game balanced (O’Connor, 2020).  Some musical knowledge is needed to design the musical score.</p>

  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>This game will help to fill a hole in the market and allow players to be able to cooperate with other players to run dungeons and raid dungeons, without having to spend between two to six hours at their computer.  This game will allow players with time constraints to get all the benefits of playing an MMORPG without the hassle of trying to organise dungeon groups, or raid dungeon groups, and also eliminates the hassle of dealing with player who steal loot dropped by dungeon and raid dungeon bosses.</p>

  <h2>Finances</h2>
  <h3>Funding</h3>
  <p>At the beginning of the project, the team will either be one developer who will create all the code and the game assets to get a proof-of-concept idea working, or to the Alpha phase of testing.  After the game reaches the Alpha phase of testing, then the process will begin to see if there are any potential backers who would be willing to finance the project either via either crowdsourcing the funds or by seeing if there are any potential investors who will be willing to fun the project.  Auroch Digital (2021) suggest that for an indie game the projected range of cost for a project is between $50,000 to $750,000, so a typical indie games developer with 5 staff and a 2 year development time would be seeing a development cost of between $250,000 and $500,000, and an extra $250,000 for advertising costs.</p>

  <h3>Revenue</h3>
  <p>This game will make it money by getting users to watch in-game advertising for rewards, such as extra dungeon tokens, or item drop-rate boosters.  In-game ad revenue for rewarded video ads, is $0.02 per impression and generate between $10 to $50 per 1000 ad impressions or effective cost per mille (eCPM) (IronSource n.d.).  Game developers can also utilise interstitial, which are full-screen advertisements played during loading screens, and these pay $0.16 per completion and generate between $10 to $20 eCPM for tier 1 countries (IronSource n.d.).  There is also another means to earn revenue via in-game advertising, and that is via the use of an offerwall, which acts as a mini-store inside the programs which can take users to various offers and rewards users for meeting certain criteria, and offerwalls can generate up to $940 eCPM (IronSource n.d.).  The game will also include an in-game store where users can purchase items, such as equipment, item drop-rate boosters and other expendable resources for real money.</p>

  <h2>Scope of Project</h2>
  <h3>Time Frame</h3>
  <p>Since the game will start off with only a single developer, there is a one year expected time frame, just to see some sort of progress, and two to three years just to get to playable state, Alpha phase, maybe Beta phase.  The game will be built up slowly, and in the beginning only the core features, such as enemy AI, bosses, weapon, armour, and accessory loot drops, and then expanding to include new areas which will bring out new bosses and new loot drops.  The expansion patches for the game will likely take 6 months to 1 year to complete.</p>

    </ul>

  </ul>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p>As a game reaches the market and becomes popular, there will be a need to increase the number of Concurrent Users (CCU).  Atavism offers Games Developers that utilise Unity the ability to purchase a higher CCU, starting at $29 per month for 100 CCU, up to $128 per month for 10000 CCU (Atavism 2021).  Whereas Amazon GameLift offers an Auto-scaling feature meaning that you only pay for what you use, with prices ranging from $8.80 per month to $279.05 per month for spot instances, where your server fills an empty spot on a AWS server until they spot is needed and then it is closed, to $44.53 to $1,866.61 per month for on-demand instances (Amazon Web Services 2021).</p>

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>To protect against hackers, developers can recode their login pages and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) according to the OWASP Reverse Engineering and Code Modification Prevention Project best practices (Akamai 2019).  OWASP (2021) states that to prevent reverse engineering attacks requires the use of a commercial obfuscation tool to obfuscate string tables and methods, then run a de-obfuscating tool like IDA Pro and Hopper.  Games developers also need to utilise anti-DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protections (Akamai 2019).  Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure was designed to be resistant to DDoS attacks and is supported by a DDoS mitigation system that automatically detects malicious traffic and then filters it out (Leung 2017).  Amazon GameLift includes a resource protection feature that prevent one player from creating multiple game session to use up all available resources, by allowing the Game Developer to set a resource creation limit policy which specifies the maximum number of game sessions one player can create within a set time limit (Leung 2017).  Amazon also recommends that Game Developers design their game servers to detect and filter out malicious traffic by declining any excessive requests that exceed server capacity by enforcing a maximum number of concurrent requests or at the Load Balancer, eroutes all client requests across all servers capable of handling the request (Leung 2017; NGINX n.d.).  Another method to prevent attacks is by utilising bot management solutions (Akamai 2019). Bot management involves detecting bot activity, and then determining whether that bot exhibiting undesirable behaviour, and then identifying the sources of undesirable activity (Cloudflare 2021). The last way to prevent attacks mentioned by Akamai (2021) is to used a Identity as a Service (IDaaS) provider to supply cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) through the use of multi-factor authentication (Cloudflare 2021).</p>

  <h3>Competitors</h3>
  <p>One major competitor and one of my main influences for why the game even been considered in the first place is Bit Heroes, which is a dungeon-crawling MMORPG, based on old-school turn-based RPGs (Juppiomenz 2017).</p>

  <h1>Project Description</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <h3>Topic</h3>
  <p>This project will involve developing a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG).</p>
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>Traditional MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, developed by Blizzard Entertainment, and Final Fantasy XIV, developed by Square Enix, require players to make a massive time commitment, as dungeons can require anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, and raid dungeons can take 3-4 hours once the group has successfully completed it, and 3-4 hours while the group is still learning how to complete boss fights.  This game will be developed to give people the option to run dungeons and raid without the time commitment, as boss fights will be designed to last only a few minutes, and teams will be created by selecting other players from your Friends List or Guild, and battle can either be done automatically or the player can select the skills used by their character and other team members.</p>
  <p>World of Warcraft was released in 2004, and since then the majority of their original player base has likely stopped playing as real-life commitments, such as work or families, started to take up all their free time.  This project is being designed to fill a hole in the market and will be trying to keep all the intrigue of traditional MMORPGs, just without the time commitment.</p>
  <p>The Video Game Industry has gone through significant changes since MMORPGs first entered the market in the last 1990s.  The current trends in the Video game Industry revolve around creating video games for the mobile device market, as well as consumers backing Indie Game developers (Game Designing n.d; Howarth 2021).  Games like Stardew Valley, which has sold over 15 million copies since it was first released in 2016 (Taylor 2021) and Terraria, which sold over 35 million copies since its release in 2011 (Blake 2021) have shown that smaller Games Developers can make popular games.</p>
  <p>This project would show a potential employer your knowledge and understanding of programming languages, as well as your ability to work with and communicate with other team members, as well as your ability to work independently and problem-solve.</p>
  <h3>Landscape</h3>
  <p>The Google search for “casual MMORPGs” returns a lot of different results, but the majority of the websites lists games like Guild War 2, Elder Scrolls Online, Final Fantasy XIV, Warframe, Neverwinter, Star Trek Online, Trove, MapleStory 2, Pathe of Exile, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Phantasy Star Online 2 (José 2021; Olivetti 2018).  None of these games do what this project will be designed to do, in that they still require a decent time investment to make any sort of progress.  One major competitor and one of my main influences for why the game even been considered in the first place is Bit Heroes, which is a dungeon-crawling MMORPG, based on old-school turn-based RPGs (Juppiomenz 2017).  Bit Heroes is designed so that players can fight enemies and can collect enemies and use them as members of your team during solo content, in a similar manner to Pokémon.  The game this project aims to create will be a cross of Bit Heroes with old-style RPGs like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy. </p>

  <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
  <h3>Aims</h3>
  <p>The most important parts of this project will be to develop the artwork, and architecture needed to create a prototype.  Rapid prototyping will likely be utilised to quickly mock out the idea behind the game, then add slightly more detail over multiple iterations until a fully detailed prototype which could be used to highlight the features of the game.  The finalised prototype will only look at one small section of the map, and will need to highlight how movement works, as well as the movement of enemy mobs, Player versus Environment (PvE) combat with enemy mobs and dungeon bosses, as well as looting, and the player’s inventory system.  The major goal would be to create the combat for dungeon bosses, as ensuring that these fights are enjoyable and only take 3-5 minutes to complete is the entire point of the project.</p>

  <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
  <p>The project was created due to the lack of availability for gamers who are time-limited, yet still desire to play MMORPGs.  The main reasons behind the creation of this project are the amount of time it takes to find a group to run a dungeon or a raid dungeon, as well as the amount of time it takes to actually complete a dungeon and raid dungeon.  There are seven stages of video game development, these being: Planning, Pre-Production, Production, Testing, Pre-Launch, and Launch.  This project is in the Planning stage, where the game has been defined as an MMORPG for time-limited players and will be aimed to be released onto Steam for the PC market, as well as onto the Google Player and Apple Apps Store (Pickell 2019).  This game has yet to start the Pre-Production stage, where the game has yet to have storyboarding started, and milestones have yet to be decided (Pickell 2019).</p>

  <h3>Roles</h3>
  <b>Have you defined any specific roles for your project?  Describe and justify these.</b>
  <p>The Designer will be responsible for overseeing the entire development of the game.  They will be responsible for the creation of all gameplay mechanics, game features, different modes (Player vs Environment, and Player vs Player), and character progression (Davidson 2017).  They will also be responsible for designing levels by incorporating assets designed by the artist to create environments that challenge the player, such as the placement of enemies (Davidson 2017).  They will also be designing the system, so that progression is both challenging for the player, as well as being fun, as well as ensuring that the game is well balanced, both in terms of gameplay as well as for the economy, rewards, and currencies (Davidson 2017).  They will also be designing the User Interface (UI) and will mark out a wireframe for the location of menus, buttons, character bars, such as heath, mana, rage, or energy, as well as the general functionality of how the player interacts with the game (Davidson 2017).  They will also be creating the story of the game, character creation, dialogue, quests (including enemies, and rewards), and pacing (Davidson 2017).</p>
  <p>The Artist will be responsible for creating all the 2D environment assets (backgrounds and scenery), character assets (designing all the key frames), character animations, UI assets (menus, character bars, and buttons), and working with the Programmer and Designer to ensure that all game art assets are imported into the game correctly (Davidson 2017).</p>
  <p>The Programmer will be responsible for creating for creating the underlying code architecture for the game, as well as working closely with the Lead Designer to create gameplay features and game mechanics, creating tools and functionality so that UI assets can be implemented by the Lead Designer (Davidson 2017).  The programmer will also be responsible for creating the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and physics systems, and ensuring that enemies, and Non-Player Characters (NPCs) can move around the environment in a logical manner, and that collusions functions work correctly (Davidson 2017).  They will also be responsible for creating the pipeline, system, and tools required for audio to be attached in the correct places throughout the game (Davidson 2017).  They will also be responsible for creating scripts and systems to find issues and bugs within the game (Davidson 2017).</p>
  <p>The Sound Designer will be responsible for creating all the music, sound effects, ambient background sounds, and user interface sounds (Davidson 2017).  They will also be working with Programmer and Designer to ensure that all sound effects are positioned in the correct portion of the game (Davidson 2017).</p>

  <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
  <p>The first step for this project would be to create a prototype for the game.  A combination of wireframe prototyping and greybox prototyping would allow someone outside the developers to be able to see the idea behind the game.  Wireframe prototyping is a great way to show how items like the User Interface, Menus etc will look before they are actually programmed and drawn up, as well as being a way to mock-up gameplay elements and mechanics to show how each connect to the others and what objects will need to be programmed, and the variables assigned to those objects (UXPin n.d.).  Greybox prototyping is a great way to show the how items like maps, towns, and dungeons will look, without having to create all the elements needed for the finished product (UXPin n.d.).  Greybox Prototyping involves substituting grey boxes for buildings, NPCs, enemy mobs, etc (West 2021).</p>

  <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
  <b>What software or other tools are required by the project?</b>
  <p>GameMaker Studio 2 offers developers a platform to create 2D video games, utilising GameMaker Language, their proprietary scripting language based off C programming language, and Drag and Drop, a visual scripting language, so that inexperienced developers can increase their understanding of programming by linking action boxes to construct the game logic, and allows the developer to view the code, to see how it functions (YoYo Games 2021).  Additional Software Development Kits (SDK) are required for Mac Integrated Development Environment (IDE), namely Mono 6, and Xcode, and Steamworks SDK 1.42 is required for Steam builds for both Mac and Windows IDEs (YoYo Games 2021).</p>
  <p>Unity offers developers a platform to create 2D, 3D, and Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality video games, and allows inexperienced developers to use Bolt Visual Scripting to connect visual nodes to construct the game logic, thus allowing developers to view the C# code, and increase their understanding of C# (Unity Technologies 2021).</p>
  <b>Are there any software licenses needed?</b>
  <p>GameMaker Studio offers three different subscriptions offering different options, including the Free subscription, which grants developers the ability to create games, access to the tutorials and community support, as well as the ability to publish the game via Opera’s GXC; the Indie subscription, which costs $14.50 per month or $139.95 per year, grants developers the same options as the Free subscription, as well as the ability to use the YoYo Compiler, allows developers to add third-party extension to their games, and to publish the game to the Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms, as well as the iOS, Android, Amazon Fire, Android TV, tvOS, and HTML5 platforms; and the Enterprise subscription, which costs $114.95 per month or $1,149.50 per year, grants developers the same option as the previous subscriptions, as well as the ability to access the Command Line Build option, and to publish their games to the PlayStation 4 and 5 platforms, as well as the Xbox One and Series X|S platforms, and the Nintendo Switch platform (YoYo Games 2021).</p>
  <p>Unity offers four different subscriptions offering different options, including the Personal subscription, which grants developers the ability to create their games, and to publish the game to Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, as well as the iOS, Android, and HTML5 platforms, as well as analytic tools, and Unity ads for mobile games, and an in-app purchase plugin; the Plus subscription, which costs $399 per year, and grants developers all the options available in the Free subscription, as well as advanced cloud diagnostic tools; the Pro subscription, which costs $1,800 per year, and grants developers all the options available in the previous subscriptions, as well as the ability to publish games to the Nintendo, PlayStation, and X-Box platforms, and increased analytic tools; and the Enterprise subscription, which costs $4,000 per month, and grants developers all the options available in the previous subscriptions, as well as technical support (Unity Technologies 2021).</p>
  <p>Unreal Engine offers three different licences offering different options, including the Publishing Licence, which is free to use, however Epic Games will take a 5% royalty when your game reaches $1 million dollars in revenue, and grants the developer all Unreal Engine features, the entire Quixel Megascans library, access to learning material, and community support; and the Custom Licence, where the cost is negotiated between the developer and Epic Games, and grants developers access to all the options offered by the Publishing License, as well as premium support, and private training.</p>
  <b>Is there any hardware needed?</b>
  <p>The recommended hardware for GameMaker Studio 2 is 64-bit OS, either Windows 10 or macOS Catalina, a Quad Core CPU, 8GB RAM, a dedicated graphics card, an SSD with 3GB free disk space, and an internet connection (YoYo Games 2021).</p>
  <p>The recommended hardware for Unity is 64-bit OS, either Windows 7 (SP1+) and Windows 10 or High Sierra 10.13+, a CPU with X64 architecture with SSE2 instruction set support, and a graphic card capable of DX10, DX11, and DX12-capable GPUs (Unity Technologies 2021).</p>
  <p>The recommended hardware for Unreal Engine 4 is Windows 10 64-bit, Quad-core 2.5 GHz CPU, 8 GB RAM, and a DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 compatible graphics card (Epic Games 2021).</p>

  <h3>Testing</h3>
  <p>There are nine different methods to test a video game, and these methods include, Combinatorial testing, which involves checking every possible combination of values for all parameters utilising Category-Partition testing, Pair testing and Catalogue based testing; Clean Room testing, which combines mathematical reasoning, design refinement, and statistical reasoning to produce minimal defect software; Functionality testing, which tests the functions of the software and whether it is working appropriately, to find bugs and errors; Compatibility testing, which involves testing whether the game functions correctly across the different platforms; Tree testing, which involves checking the menu navigation system; Regression testing, which involves re-running previous tests to ensure new features haven’t adversely impacted already added features; Ad-Hoc testing, which involves unplanned error testing utilising Error Guessing techniques; Load testing, which involves determining whether the infrastructure can keep the game running smoothly under real-world load conditions, and at peak user load; and Play testing, which involves getting users to play the game to assess all the non-functional features of the game, such as whether the game is fun to play (Test Bytes 2017).</p>

  <h3>Timeframe</h3>
  <p>This should be presented in the form of a table, with one row for each week, specifying as best you can the work for each person for each week
Since the game will start off with only a single developer, there is a one year expected time frame, just to see some sort of progress, and two to three years just to get to playable state, Alpha phase, maybe Beta phase.  The game will be built up slowly, and in the beginning only the core features, such as enemy AI, bosses, weapon, armour, and accessory loot drops, and then expanding to include new areas which will bring out new bosses and new loot drops.  The expansion patches for the game will likely take 6 months to 1 year to complete.</p>

  <h3>Risks</h3>
  <b>What risks can you identify for your project?</b>
  <p>The main risk to the game would be balancing the scale of the project.  All games being made need to be built to the level of existing games in that genre (Achrén n.d.).  Thus, this project would need to look games like Bit Heroes and Bit Legends, made by GameFun Ltd, and is a Bit Heroes clone, and RPG games like Stardew Valley, which includes dungeon-crawling elements, and was developed by a single developer over a 4 and half year time period in the visual styling, and play similar to games like Final Fantasy, with its turn-based battle system.</p>
  
  <h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3>
  <b>How will your group communicate?</b>
  <p>The main form of communication will be through an online platforms like Microsoft Teams, which allow messages to be exchanged and for calls to be made between a group of people and have more functionality than relying on email alone (Kanell n.d.).  These online platforms offer a range of options like screen sharing, file sharing, personal and group chat, video calls which are important when team members are collaborating on a project and allows for the easy sharing of information between different group members, or to the group as a whole (Yankovsky 2021).</p>
  
  <b>How often will meetings take place?</b>
  <p>A study performed by Steven Rogelberg asked senior managers in a range of industries about meetings, and their results showed that 65% of respondents stated that meetings prevent them form getting work completed, and 71% stated that meetings are unproductive and inefficient (Perlow, Hadley & Eun 2017).  Thus, team meetings are only effective when they timed well, don’t occur too often, and are led by a competent leader (Perlow, Hadley & Eun 2017).</p>
  <p>Group meetings will take place once per week, which was decided based on the availability of the group members.  This will allow the team to prioritize and complete any tasks required.  With that, this will further promote group members to bring forward new strategies and ideas.  Any issues that need to be addressed can be brought to the attention of the team leader, and a personal team meeting can be scheduled to address these issues.</p>
  
  <b>Will these be face-to-face, or using technologies such as Skype?</b>
  <p>The project will be executed through the use of technology; therefore, it is important that communication is kept online too.  With that, the group will communicate through two applications, this being Skype and Microsoft Teams.  This will allow for easy connections to be made amongst group members, as messages can be exchanged, and calls can be made regardless of the devices each person holds.</p>
  
  <b>What will you do if you have a group member who does not respond to communications?</b>
  <p>If a member does not respond to any form of group communication made to them, a personal message will be sent to them to find out and understand why.  With that, any issues that arise will be dealt accordingly, whether it is done through a personal or group meeting. However, if the unresponsive team member does not respond, it will be taken further up to the course convenor.</p>

  <h3>Feedback</h3>
  <p></p>
  
  <h3>Group Reflection</h3>
  <b>What went well?</b>
  <p>The process of communicating via Microsoft Teams made team meetings easier and gave several communication avenues for which team members could raise issues with the team leader.</p> 
  
  <b>What could be improved?</b>
  <p>Scheduling team meetings was the hardest part to handle.  This was a result of scheduling issues, and on times team members weren't able to make the arranged meeting due to outside influences.</p> 
  
  <b>At least one thing that was surprising.</b>
  <p>The versatility of Microsoft Teams, especially in its ability to share files, as well as  screen sharing capabilities, allows team meetings to progress smoothly, and allows all team members to be able to view the same document, and address issues as they are raised.</p> 
  
  <b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</b>
  <p>Team meetings are a necessity in group projects, however they really only need to be limited to defining the project tasks, and assigning these tasks, as well as the deadline for when these tasks need to be completed.  For most issues, a one-on-one meeting could easily resolve the issue.</p> 
  
  <b>Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your GitHub log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.</b>
  <p>The Contributors section of the Insights doesn't accurately show how much work was done by the team members.  Most of the work of editing the GitHub repository was handled by one team member, however this only shows that team member editing the index.md file to insert and format the work prepared by the other team members.  The project was a team effort where team members chose to do specific tasks and then all the work was brought together by David and added to the index.md file.  This issue was mainly a result of the other team members not having the required permissions to edit the index.md file, and this situation was only resolved late in the process once it was brought to David's attention.</p>
